Bold Creative Law |&amp;&amp;| Tech Exp.

Shalalalaw is a technology attorney with an education in computer science specifically so he could be the tech attorney that understood how it all works. He loves how it all works, and is constantly devising new ways to disrupt the legal  field. Having gone through traditional iterations of projects, he figured why not crank things up a bit and bring things to life in a web3 context. 

If you are a lawyer and computer scientist, and you think of yourself as a creative type, then this is the right place for you. If you are either more firmly a lawyer or computer scientist but have a passion for the instersection between the two fields, then we would love to have you aboard. This is an experiment, and I'm excited to see what kind of monster we can Frankenstein together.
