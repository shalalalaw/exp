Bold Creative Law |&amp;&amp;| Tech Exp.

Shalalalaw is a technology attorney with an education in computer science specifically so he could be the tech attorney that understood how it all works. He loves how it all works, and is constantly devising new ways to disrupt the legal  field. Having gone through traditional iterations of projects, he figured why not crank things up a bit and bring things to life in a web3 context. 

If you are a lawyer and computer scientist, and you think of yourself as a creative type, then this is the right place for you. If you are either more firmly a lawyer or computer scientist but have a passion for the instersection between the two fields, then we would love to have you aboard. This is an experiment, and I'm excited to see what kind of monster we can Frankenstein together.

# Notes
## Pain Point
Every law firm knows the pain of having some form of legal tech that promises world but delivers a fraction. These tools are often no less critical pieces of a firm's infrastructure. Where does that leave us? We are left to hop from one tool to the next looking for the perfect solution, integrate a plethora of systems via automation tools, or we have to invest in the creation of a bespoke tool from scratch. These solutions leave firms with new problems: each new tool is so focused on solving one problem that they neglect the next one, tools that are not very good become heavily-integrated legacy systems that can't be abandoned for one reason or another, or firms must make major financial investments to create the perfect tool (which then requires constant maintenace, upgrades, and integrations of its own).
## Solution
A grassroots, community-oriented collaboration platform for firms looking to solve specific problems with their technology and share their solutions.
## Execution
We need a low-effort, low-commitment way to collaborate, share, take risks, and supercharge our solutions. Enter the DAO.

### Not your grandfather's DAO

When you hear the word DAO you either think "WTH is that?" or you think "Oh, an investment vehicle with iffy interpretations of tax law." 
Not us. We are using the DAO as a mechanism for high-speed governance and collaboration. The DAO is a properly-wrapped Series LLC formed in the state of Texas. DAO governance mechanisms permit members to spin up their own independent work silos (independently-operated LLC series, created via the sub-DAOs) that in no way commit other members of the DAO to any action, but provide a way to document membership and grant access to a set of collaborative tools. 

Each legitimate member of the DAO is granted access to use any other tool or code to supplement their own efforts, and each sub-DAO can request (volunteered) support from other members of the DAO. In this way, firms can lean on each other to build out their systems, tech nerds can try their hands at experimental or imaginative solutions, and those who gain traction have a network of support around them.

## FAQ
### What is a DAO?
A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. In simple terms it automates traditional governance mechanisms — voting, minutes, treasury management, documentation. Things that typically require manual tracking are entirely managed via a software solution. DAO is just a fancy word for what is otherwise a straightforward solution. DAOs are run on the blockchain, but that doesn't mean it's automatically a cryptocurrency. Blockchain is a type of collective system that manages data. Traditional data solutions are managed by a single source of failure — like a cloud storage solution or SaaS platform. Blockchain solutions create redundant, transparent copies data across participant machines. Instead of using a tank of a computer to manage everything, everyone's device chips in to share the load. The focus of this DAO is as a collaborative tool, with clear rules of engagement, formed beneath the proper channels.
### How do I get involved?
The Discord is the best place to start. Discord is a less formal type of Slack or Teams tool. txhq.org/discord
### Do I have to pay money to join?
No, but if you want to form a sub-DAO, you are responsible for the associated fees (currently a few cents on the blockchain and about $25 with the state).
### How do I get a subDAO set up?
For now, we are handling those transactions manually, but we are working to create a streamlined mechanism for those who want to participate.
